# 8fold Schema

8fold Schema is designed to make interacting with structured data for the web easier.

The first library being tested is the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary for adding metadata to the web. This metadata not only helps with search engine optimization, but may also help improve the accessibility and experience of your site for those using assistive technologies. The vocabulary includes dozens of standardized objects, fields, and relationships.
